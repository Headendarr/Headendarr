# TV Guide & DVR

Once your channels are mapped and EPG data is assigned, you can use the **TV Guide** to browse what's on and schedule recordings with the built-in DVR functionality.

This functionality relies on the integrated TVHeadend server, so it is primarily available for users of the All-in-One (AIO) installation.

## TV Guide

Navigate to the **TV Guide** page to see a familiar grid-based Electronic Programme Guide.

-   **Timeline**: The guide displays channels on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis.
-   **Navigation**: You can scroll vertically to browse channels and horizontally to move forward and backward in time.
-   **Programme Details**: Click on any programme in the grid to see more details, such as the show description, episode name, and air time.

## DVR (Digital Video Recorder)

The DVR allows you to schedule recordings for upcoming programmes.

### Scheduling a Recording

1.  Find the programme you want to record in the **TV Guide**.
2.  Click on the programme to open the details view.
3.  Click the **Record** button.
4.  A dialog will appear with recording options:
    -   **Record Series**: If the EPG data supports it, you can choose to record only the single episode or the entire series.
    -   **Recording Profile**: Select a recording profile. These profiles control the file naming and directory structure for the recording and can be configured in the [Application Settings](./application-settings.md#dvr-settings).
5.  Click **Save** to schedule the recording.

A red "recording" icon will appear on the programme in the guide to indicate that it is scheduled to be recorded.

### Managing Recordings

Navigate to the **DVR** page to view and manage your scheduled and completed recordings.

The DVR page has several tabs:

-   **Upcoming**: Shows all recordings that are scheduled for the future. You can cancel upcoming recordings from this view.
-   **Finished**: A list of all recordings that have successfully completed. You can play back or download recordings from here (if supported by your browser) and delete the files.
-   **Failed**: Shows any recordings that did not complete successfully. This can help in troubleshooting issues with streams or EPG data.

### DVR Settings

Default DVR settings, such as pre- and post-recording padding and file naming conventions, can be configured in the main application settings.

See the [Application Settings](./application-settings.md#dvr-settings) page for more details.
